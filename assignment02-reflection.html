<h1>Assignment 02 Reflection</h1>
<p><span class="tab"></span>The main issues I had with Assignment 2 were: trying to use the sticky position to make the navigation bar, centering both images in the campus life section, and figuring out how to use float, position, and text decoration on different states for the anchor tags. There were a lot of parts which I am now very familiar with, like making a heading, footer, copyright information, basic CSS, and I enjoyed trying to figure out how to design the webpage in my own way, but the part where I had to figure out why the navigation bar was not working properly did give me a headache. It still troubles me whenever I have to use multiple selectors and having to edit each one without getting any issues, so now I know that I just need to read more about all the types of attributes you can use for the selectors and elements. I will say that the assignment instructions could be a little more comprehensive so that I can get more out of it, and I feel like I had to find most of the answers online and not on the lecture notes or recordings. I think that the most useful aspect of this assignment was to understand how to separate every part of a webpage and how to make a proper navigation bar at the top of the page, and even though I still have a lot of learning to do I believe that I am able to create basic web pages, so I would say that the assignment was in fact useful for my learning.</p>
