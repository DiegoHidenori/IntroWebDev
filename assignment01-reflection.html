    <p><span class="tab"></span>One of the main challenges I had was when I had to link folder files: When I first attempted to create any type of file path to a folder, I would always get some type of error, which was really annoying. It took me some, but I did figure out what was going wrong: The links were made according to the hosting site file structure, not on my personal computer's file structure. Once I figured that out, I clicked on the links through my GBLearn account and they would work fine. That's when I realized that the whole point of using a hosting site is for it to work online so that others can see it, not for it to work on my computer only. Another issue I had was when trying to figure out how to add my ID at the top of the page: Since there was no place to add my ID, I decided to add it as a heading. Whenever I would have an issue with the links/references, I would first look at the path I wrote and see if I made a mistake there. For me, that step was enough to fix those issues. Once I was done with the assignment, I clicked on the JavaScript HTML validator to check if there were any errors or warnings on my codes, and fortunately there was none. This assignment made me realize that I need to practice more on the three types of paths used to understand the file structure better. It still confuses me sometimes when I try to imagine the structure when using document relative paths because they are not the same when I write it for the hosting site file structure as when I write it for my personal computer's file structure.</p>
